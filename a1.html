        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Sketching</p>
        For this assignment, I started out by sketching some ideas 
        just to brainstorm what might be an interesting shape that 
        could make a fun a construction kit. Maybe it was the 
        beautiful cherry blossoms I've been seeing around, or maybe 
        it was the springtime hay fever, but the first shape that came
        to mind was a flower. I kept sketching to try to challenge 
        myself to come up with more complex and irregular shapes, 
        shapes that would fit together in surprising ways, or shapes 
        that fit a cute theme.<br>
        I tried to imagine what kinds of 3D forms you could make with 
        a kit of each shape, especially if we could also incorporate 
        other types of objects, like toothpicks or strings. I was in 
        imminent danger of falling down a geometric rabbit hole  
        when I realized I should probably just start cutting some stuff 
        out and see what happened.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Prototyping</p>
        I got out an exacto knife, an old cutting mat from a brief 
        foray into scrapbooking, and a sheet of foam and started cutting 
        out some of the shapes I had sketched. I tried out an idea for an 
        asterisk that could notch together to become a sort of 3D connector. 
        I tried attaching some triangles and stars to that piece. I'm not 
        sure what I was expecting, but I guess I was hoping I'd be able to 
        make more of a closed shape?<br>
        I tested out some interlocking cats which were sorta fun, and some 
        vaguely orange-inspired pieces, but I didn't like that those could 
        really only fit together through one slot at the stem. I cut out a few flower 
        shapes and tried different ways of fitting them together with the 
        leaf pieces. At this point I started worrying about the limitations 
        I would face trying to draw all these shapes in a software that was 
        new to me.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Modeling</p>
        The next day I started trying to figure out the modeling part. I 
        started in Rhino, but felt a little overwhelmed so I thought I 
        could at least make a first draft in Cuttle. I thought the flower 
        shape would be the easiest to get started with. I took a bunch of 
        measurements of my cardboard piece with my calipers, but found that 
        it varied quite a lot due to different squish coefficients 
        (scientific term) in different spots of the cardboard. I took 
        an average-ish of .1 inches, guessing that beyond that level of 
        precision wouldn't be super valuable with this irregular of a material.
        I headed into the lab with a partially prepared Cuttle file, a few 
        scraps of cardboard, and a dream.<br>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Cutting & Refining</p>
        flo and I planned to try to catch each other at the lab, and I am 
        so glad we did because my morale was much improved by having a 
        friendly face to ask questions instead of flipping back and forth 
        endlessly through the instructions, afraid to break something or 
        accidentally commit arson. She walked me through my first cut. I set 
        the speed to 25%, the power level to 100%, and this charming little 
        fellow popped out!

        <br>But as cute as he may be, I tried to stick him onto the edge of 
        my cardboard piece and he immediately fell off:-( For my second test cut, 
        I narrowed the slots to .08 inches, and made the whole thing bigger just 
        for fun.

        <br>Flower Test 2 successfully stayed on the edge of my cardboard square! 
        I was a little concerned about things still fitting well as pieces 
        got cut closer to the center, where the cardboard was less squished, but 
        I figured it was better too snug than too loose since the material had some 
        give. I tried cutting out a leaf shape next now that I had a workable slot size.<br>
        <object data="assignment1\leaf.svg" width="300" height="300"> </object>
        <br>These fit together well enough, but I had grand ideas of being able 
        to fit a leaf piece through the center hole of the flower, and then it could 
        be secured on the other side of the hole by notching into the longer 
        side slot of another leaf piece?? To what end... I don't know... Some 
        sort of flower-wheeled jalopy?? Anyways... I tried one more flower cut 
        with a bigger center hole, plus a leaf with shorter side slots.<br>

        <object data="assignment1\leaf 2.svg" width="300" height="300"> </object>
        <br>Even with the bigger hole, my leaf/flower wheel wasn't working so hot. 
        I also realized that the flowers would make terrible wheels. And that 
        even if you did cobble together a two-wheeled contraption, it wouldn't be 
        a very versatile piece because if you wanted it to have any chance of rolling 
        you'd probably have to stop building with only five or so pieces, which 
        isn't very fun. Oh well!! Maybe the next construction kit will be more 
        functional than sculptural. In the meantime, I decided to go with my second 
        flower iteration and my second leaf and cut 31 leaves and 18 flowers!

        <br>Once all the leaves and flowers had been cut, I tried assembling something 
        with them. There were a few pieces that were a little dicey trying to notch 
        together, but for the most part they fit great! I tried out building with as 
        many different notch combinations as I could think of, and ended up with a 
        sort of bush-looking sculpture. I gave it the Dairy Queen Blizzard test and 
        it held together!

        <br>On our way out of the lab, I stopped to take a picture of the sculpture 
        with her mother:
