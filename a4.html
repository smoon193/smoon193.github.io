        Option 2: Design and 3D print a box that press-fits together tightly enough to hold sugar.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Research</p>
        Since I knew I would be missing last week's class, I started this assignment by reading through the slides, watching a few woodworking videos about various types of joins,
        and even found this fancy chart about interference fits for dowels? (from https://www.fictiv.com/articles/too-tight-or-perfect-fit-when-to-use-press-fits-in-your-assemblies)
        <img src="assignment4\interference_fit_table.png" />
        
        ...And ultimately decided to just wing it and try out a couple tiny panels with box joints to get a baseline to see what I'd need to adjust.
        <img src="assignment4\test_panels.png"/>
        <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Attempt 1</p>
          For my first attempt, I wanted to see what would happen if I just asked the printer to make panels with the same size of fingers 
          as grooves (4mm each). I was curious how close the flexibility of the material and the error of the printer would get me to a working box joint.

          <br>
          <img src="assignment4\attempt1.png"/>
          The joints would not fit together at all, but they seemed pretty close. I measured each of the fingers to see how accurate the print was.

          <br><br>
          For the piece with 3 fingers, I measured each of them at about 4.06mm. I remembered the slides had some suggestions for what to start adjusting 
          if your print was precise but not accurate, but then when I measured the piece with two fingers, I got measurements between 3.98mm and 4.06mm, 
          which seemed like a pretty wide range relative to the difference one of the woodworking videos said there should be between groove and finger.
          This also threw off any potential adjustments I was thinking of making since it was no longer simply a problem of the whole print being off by 
          the same amount consistently.

          <br><br>
          <p style="font-weight: bold;">Attempt 2</p>
          For my next attempt, I tried the same test panel shape, but with 3.9mm pegs, still separated by 4mm slots. After they 
          printed, the actual measurements of the pegs were 3.98mm, 3.94mm, and 3.89mm on the 3-peg side, and 3.91mm and 3.90mm on 
          the 2-peg side.
          <br><br>
          This time the panels fit together comfortably, but not snugly enough to hold together.

          <br><br>
          <p style="font-weight: bold;">Attempt 3</p>
          At this point I was getting a little worried that with this much error in the prints, I wouldn't be able to get the 
          actual measurements accurate enough to achieve joints that fit together consistently across the box. 
          But since I had one attempt that was too snug, and one attempt that was too loose, I thought it would be worth 
          one more shot with 3.95mm pegs. I also tried setting Prusa Slicer from the "speed" to the "structural" setting.

          These ones held together!!! This was enough for me to try kicking off a larger test with box joints on all sides so that I could 
          theoretically make a box. I couldn't quite figure out how the top and bottom would fit together with the sides, but I 
          just printed two panels with 3 slots on top and 3 grooves on bottom and figured if those worked, I could print two more 
          and then maybe it would be more obvious what shape I'd need for the top and bottom once I put those together.

          <br><br>
          <p style="font-weight: bold;">4cm Test</p>
          Once the first two full-size panels came out, I tried to fit them together but they weren't working. Did the prints have too 
          much error?? Did I design them wrong so that they'd have weird corners or something??? Was I just too dumb to put the 
          puzzle together?!?

          After fiddling with it for an embarrassing amount of time, I finally realized the problem... In my model I 
          hadn't noticed that I had spaced out one of the pegs by only 3mm instead of 4 &#128565;&#128565;&#128565;&#128565;

          <br><br>
          I fixed the offending joint and as of about 10pm on the 15th, I kicked off 4 of these and was hoping I would have one more chance before class to run to the lab and 
          check how they came out and maybe even print a top and bottom piece.

          <br><br>
          However as of 1:14pm on the 24th, the final box is still a mystery~~
          <br><br>
          Stay tuned to find out if I can ditch work in time to go figure out the last pieces before class!!
