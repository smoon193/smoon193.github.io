        Option 2: Design and 3D print a box that press-fits together tightly enough to hold sugar.

        I read through the slides and watched a few woodworking videos about different types of joins and decided to just wing it 
        and try out a couple tiny panels with box joints to get a baseline to see what I'd need to adjust.
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Attempt 1</p>
          For my first attempt, I wanted to see what would happen if I just asked the printer to make panels with the same size of fingers 
          as grooves (4mm each). I was curious how close the flexibility of the material and the error of the printer would get me to a working box joint.

          The joints would not fit together at all, but they seemed pretty close. I measured each of the fingers to see how accurate the print was.

          For the piece with 3 fingers, I measured each of them at about 4.06mm. I remembered the slides had some suggestions for what to start adjusting 
          if your print was precise but not accurate, but then when I measured the piece with two fingers, I got measurements between 3.98mm and 4.06mm, 
          which seemed like a pretty wide range relative to the difference one of the woodworking videos said there should be between groove and finger.
          This also threw off any potential adjustments I was thinking of making since it was no longer simply a problem of the whole print being off by 
          the same amount consistently.

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">Attempt 2</p>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">Attempt 3</p>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">4cm test</p>
          bye i put one of the fingers down only 3 mm instead of 4

          I was also struggling so much to put the puzzle together and wasn't sure if that was because it wouldnt fit together on certain 
          sides cuz I made it wrong or if it wouldn't have fit together right either way. I fixed the finger placement and decided to print only 4 of the same one 
          and if that worked out I could try printing special top and bottom pieces to fit into whatever edges resulted from the 4 pieces fit together
