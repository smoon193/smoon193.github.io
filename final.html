        sarah's mildly cursed knitting kit:D
        <br><br>
        concept
        <br>
        I wanted to make a cute knitting kit with some of the little odds and ends I'm missing 
        from my existing kit! I designed the project so that I could start small and work my way 
        up, and in the end I was able to add four pieces to the collection. 

        <br><br>
        bill of materials
        <br>- cardboard
        <br>- PLA filament 
        <br>- OOMOO 
        <br>- jump rings, chain, clasp

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Gauge Measuring Square</p>
        <div class="header">
          <img src="final\gauge_measurer_stitch_markers.png" />
          <div>
            I designed a gauge measuring square with a 4x4 inch window to easily 
            measure your gauge, or how many stitches per inch you have, to ensure 
            your final knitted product will fit how you want it to. 4x4 inches is a pretty standard 
            gauge swatch, and having it as a little window vs. a floppy tape measure 
            helps you press your fabric flat to get an accurate measurement.

            <br><br>
            I left a wider edge to give a cute Polaroid photo looking effect, and cut swirls into it 
            so that it could also be used to hang a few of your favorite stitch markers when you're not using it.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Needle Holder</p>
        <div class="header">
          <img src="final\needle_holder.png" />
          <div>
            I had a bunch of tapestry and darning needles in my knitting kit, some loose 
            and some in bulky packaging. I decided to make a more organized and space-efficient 
            needle storage solution that could fit well into my existing kit! 

            <br><br>
            I measured both types of needles and 3D printed some tests in the shape that I 
            wanted the final needle holder to be. Once I had a had a decent fit, 
            I 3D printed the negative of that shape to make a mold. The silicone is nice and 
            bendy so it can flexibly fit into the nooks and crannies of my knitting kit!

            I decided to make the practical, problem-solving stuff first, but I was most 
            excited to try designing some stitch markers. These loop around your knitting 
            needles to help you keep count of your stitches and separate different sections of your knitting.

            <br><br>
            I started by drawing some silly shapes like wiggly stars and hearts. Then I thought, 
            how could I make these even more whimsical?? And engraved some text emojis 
            into them. I added some jewelry hardware I had lying around to make a few different 
            styles of stitch markers for all your stitch-marking needs!

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Scissor Stopper</p>
        <div class="header">
          <img src="final\scissor_stopper.png" />
          <div>
            Look I know I said in my proposal that one of my extra time add-on projects would 
            be needle stoppers not a scissor stopper but hear me out!! The mold ended up 
            coming out with a shape that fit the flattened tip of my scissors better than 
            the rounded tip of knitting needles, and I already have a few pairs of needle 
            stoppers but nothing to protect the sharp end of my scissors!! Who am I to argue with fate!!

            <br><br>
            To stay on brand, I used one of the shapes I used to make the stitch markers, but 
            extruded it a bit more and added a hole into the middle of the bottom instead of through it. Then I subtracted this shape 
            from a rectangular prism to make a mold, which I 3D printed and then cast the silicone 
            into.
