        The first part I designed for my lamp was the upper disk I planned to notch the cord into to increase 
        the diameter off of which I could hang my lamp. I thought this way I'd have more room to make fun shapes vs. 
        worrying about dispersing a lot of width between the widest part of my lampshade and the part that needed to attach.

        I measured the cord of my lamp and found that it was about 3.5mm on its narrower side. In Rhino, I cut a 3.5mm slot in a circle 
        and then added a circle with a 3.5mm diameter centered at the middle of the circle so the cord would hopefully hang in the center 
        of the disk. 

        <br><br>
        I was debating how big I should make the diameter of the upper disk while my initial notch test was printing, but then when 
        it finished I realized it came out about 60mm vs more like 30mm like I was expecting lol. I decided to just go with it since 
        60mm is about the width of a lightbulb anyways so then I could use the disk as a reference point in my model for how narrow I could go!
        Happy accidents &#128524;

        <br><br>
        Next I started working on the top of my lamp that would hang off of the upper disk. I tried a short test of a rounded shape with 
        a top hole that was 3mm smaller than the disk. This one looked nice since it sat so closely to the disk, but I wanted it 
        to feel like it wouldn't get knocked off so easily. I printed another test, this time 6mm smaller, and thought that one still 
        looked pretty decent but felt much sturdier!

        </div>

        <br><br>
        Next I tried a print of a wavy shape closer to how I envisioned my lamp. I drew some control point curves in Rhino, and lofted between 
        them and a circle at the top of the diameter I had just determined from my previous tests. The first print completely crashed and 
        burned. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to look at spaghetti again without being filled with dread after this class.. &#128576;

        <br><br>
        I tried a second test, this time instead of lofting between different curves I tried scaling the same curve so it would be sort of 
        concentric and hopefully create less weird unpredictable angles trying to loft in different directions. This one came out pretty 
        decently besides when it got to the very top, so I adjusted my model one last time to lengthen it a bit to make sure the 
        angle near the top stayed above 45 degrees, and kicked off one more print.

        When I returned to the lab, to my delight I found that my top lamp part had printed well!! Somewhere along the line it occurred to me 
        that I would need to make my lamp in multiple parts that hung off each other since I wouldn't be able to print tall enough 
        on the printer to cover the whole 20 ish cm that I needed between the cord and the end of the lightbulb. Next I tried out some slices 
        of what would be the top of the next piece. I thought the first one sat a little high, so I made it a bit bigger and decided that would be a 
        good size for my next piece!

          <img src="assignment6\first_piece2_test.png"/>
          <img src="assignment6\second_piece2_test.png"/>
        </div>

        <br><br>
        I repeated this process to make the third lamp part. I was struggling a lot with getting my prints to stick as the diameters were 
        increasing, but I was reluctant to add a brim since I didn't want to disrupt the smooth shape of my lamp. However after about the fourth 
        failed print I decided a brim was necessary for my sanity! So I added one and actually it came off super easily and cleanly. 

        <br><br>
        Aaaaaaand finally we have a lamp!!!!!!!

        As of 9:08pm on Tuesday night there is not much to show for Molding and Casting pt. 1 ;_; So far I read through the tutorial Emily posted, 
        and started looking for little guys I could cast on Thingiverse. At the time of writing, this is the strongest contender:
