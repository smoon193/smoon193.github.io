        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Sketching</p>
        Sketching was a lot tougher for this assignment because I was trying to think in terms of shapes that could fit together to form a surface. Professor Nadya said we didn't really need to make a whole lamp shape like we tried in class, but I was interested to try something closer to that type of interlock vs. just slotting together like in the first assignment.
        I couldn't think of any cute shapes that could interlock like that, so I resolved to keep it simple and try to get started in Rhino since I'd be learning that for the first time after using Cuttle last week.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Prototyping</p>
        My prototyping attempt this week was pretty pathetic &#128514;
        I was trying to come up with the simplest shape I could that might still notch together to form a surface with a semi-bendy material.

        This section is where you're going to start regretting giving me a free-form write-up prompt &#128514;
        <br><br>
        As soon as I opened up Rhino my mind went completely blank. Everything we went over during the walkthrough on Wednesday evaporated from my mind. 
        I tried to draw and resize a square, a simple wholesome shape, a family shape, and I was immediately flummoxed. I tried to resize it by dragging the corner as usual, but only the one corner moved. What could be the sense in that?! Did Rhino not know what a square was?!?? 
        I started panicking because if I couldn't figure out how to draw a mere square then I'd never be able to complete the assignment and then I'd get an F in the class and have to drop out and change my name and put on a false mustache and flee the country.
        I went home and texted flo with news of my defeat and hoped that if I came back to the lab the following day there might at least be more people there I could ask for some help.
        <br><br>
        The next day flo and Eva and Celina were at the lab too so that was a relief! For the first couple hours I mostly just sat there clicking back and forth between the lamest Rhino/Grasshopper model ever, and countless tutorial videos that had absolutely nothing to do with what I needed.
        I tried drawing a simple shape in Rhino to start with and then seeing if I could scale parts of it in Grasshopper. 
        I tried about a million different variations of the Scale Non-Uniform component, the rectangle component, and anything else that seemed like it might possibly make the little slots bigger or smaller in any dimension, but nothing I did in Grasshopper was changing the shapes in Rhino.

        </div>
        <br><br>
        At this point the abject terror was setting in. I was finding it impossible to scale a rectangle and I was somehow supposed to scale all these weird sort of disconnected other bits of shapes?!?!?
        My classmates tried to help but I guess I had done something weird and/or I was just so far behind where they were in their projects that we couldn't make much sense of it.
        Every tutorial video I tried to watch was either too basic, too advanced, or totally irrelevant.

        I abandoned all hope of having a cool project or even a vaguely surface-like project. I checked the assignment again and it seemed like the important part was to make things adjustable by parameters.
        So I figured if I could get a few rectangles to scale and move, I could at least make a sort of notched tile that could be modified in a number of ways.
        As long as the slots were adjustable in width, that could account for different thicknesses of material, right? ...Right?!??! &#128560;
        The slots have no relation to the main rectangle so they can be "adjusted" clean off the tile, but who am I to tell an enterprising young engineer what to do with their model?! 
        I grant any future manufacturers of this notched tile the agency to manufacture a tile that doesn't work at all. It's an interactive performance art piece about free will and human nature!!

        Proof that it works when the Grasshopper definition is baked at 30x30mm, with 1x10mm slots for this particular scrap of cardboard!
