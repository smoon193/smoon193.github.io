        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Part 1</p>
        I checked out Thingi10K to start my search for nice meshes that I could smush together. I found this lovely bust of Sappho, 
        and a little statue of an equally profound and culturally influential figure: GIR from Invader Zim.
        <div class="grid">

        </div>
        
        <br>
        I imported both into Rhino and tried to reduce the mesh of Sappho since she was a bit unwieldy. Then I attempted to follow a 
        similar procedure to the beheading we witnessed in class last Wednesday. I put GIR's body in a box and Boolean-differenced it 
        away. At first I thought if I could just make the head a little bigger, then I could probably just fit Sappho's head inside 
        it, and Boolean union the two to make my GIR bust. However, when I tried this, a piece of Sappho's bun was left sticking out 
        and I got a message about non-manifold edges or something like that. I tried to run a few of the repair commands, but didn't 
        have much luck.
        
        <br><br>
        I undid a few things and took off as much of Sappho's head as I could manage to create a nice platform to place GIR's head 
        onto the bust. This time I got a different error about "degenerate faces." I'm guessing areas like this would be problematic, 
        where the curved part of GIR's neck meets the flat plane of Sappho's cut off head?

        After some googling and failed attempts at repairing, I remembered a command Nathan had pointed out during his office hours, 
        Shrink Wrap. I thought I'd see if that would smooth out these weird rough areas and thankfully it did!! It somehow looks even 
        crazier all weirdly smoothed out, but important art is often misunderstood during its time and Rhino said it was a good mesh 
        and that is the only art critic whose opinion I care about!!

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Part 2</p>
          As soon as I saw the Loft command in the first Rhino demo, I was like yeeeeeaahh that's the one. I just thought it created 
          really cool organic shapes! So that was the first thing I started trying out in Rhino.
          <img src="assignment5\Screenshot 2024-04-29 213621.png"/>
          
          <br>
          Making the loft was easy, so then I started to think about the important stuff like how to get it to certain dimensions and 
          how it would affix to the lamp. I flipped through a few designs on Thingiverse to get some inspiration for attachment 
          mechanisms and lightbulb interactions I could apply to the type of design I was going for. 
          <div class="grid">
            <img src="assignment5\Screenshot 2024-04-29 213936.png"/>
            <img src="assignment5\Screenshot 2024-04-29 214016.png"/>
          </div>

          <br>
          In my first attempt of a rough Rhino model, I actually thought it looked cooler with just the grid lines on vs. shaded, 
          so I was interested in the white lamp type of design where maybe I could make a slotted disk at the top, and print out 
          some sort of wavy organic panels to fit into it. However, Professor Nadya did specifically mention the stark lack of appeal 
          of a naked lightbulb, so I also started thinking about other options for covering it, like the diffuser someone made as 
          an add-on for the cellular lamp we had looked at in class.

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">Lab Time</p>
          I headed into the lab to try to catch Nathan for his office hours and hopefully start printing some experiments. 
          I pitched my still rather nebulous design idea (some sort of lofted shape? maybe a closed loft so it had an inside 
          layer? or maybe like a wireframe of a loft?) to Nathan and he gave me some considerations to think about:
          <br> 
          - size constraints of the 3D printer (if I wanted it bigger maybe I could do multiple pieces and conjoin them? with 
          box joints/dovetails? or maybe two circular pieces could screw together?)
          <br>
          - the Pipe command as a possibility for the wireframe idea
          <br>
          - the biggest thing we were running into when I tried to put my Rhino model into Prusa Slicer to start printing some tests 
          was that in vase mode, you're even more limited as to how much you can angle your structure than normal, which Nathan 
          said the limit was about 45 degrees (pls see my notes page where I wrote 45% for some reason &#128128;) we talked about 
          different ways I could possibly add thickness to the shell (but then I wouldn't be able to use vase mode) or other types 
          of attaching pieces that might help (like a slotted disk that slips around the wire to increase the diameter of the circle the 
          loft has to end in)
          <img src="assignment5\Screenshot 2024-04-29 221136.png"/>

          <br>
          I figured since I was already at the lab I should at least try to print SOMETHING even though most of my ideas seemed to 
          be dead ends. I thought I could at least get a baseline and see if whatever problems it had were fixable. After playing 
          around with the model and slicer a bunch, I had landed on some mini version of my lamp which even at a small scale was 
          looking pretty holey and unpromising.
          <img src="assignment5\Screenshot 2024-04-27 181210.png"/>

          <br>
          Okay so I must have messed up the scaling between multiple iterations back and forth from Rhino to Prusa Slicer and it came 
          out even more mini than I was expecting &#128514; And it was still super holey at the top, even though I had finagled it 
          to have a double layered shell. Nathan pointed out that any hole problems I was having at this scale would only be worse 
          at full size, soooooooooo idk. That's where I left off for now. Wondering if I should be leaning more into the wireframe + diffuser idea, unless I want to 
          abandon the shape I had in mind for a loft and do something as near-cylidrical as possible, and then just come up with some way 
          to hang that off the lamp. IDK!!!!! TBD!!!!
