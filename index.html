        My name is Sarah! I'm a 2nd year HCDE master's student. I am excited to learn about new ways of making stuff in this class because I love anything crafty/DIY! 
        I am hoping this class will help set me up to make a cool capstone project next year:) 
        I'm not sure yet what I'll be able to teach people since most of this is all new to me, but maybe I can help out with some basic stuff for the website!
