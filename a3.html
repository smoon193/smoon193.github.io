        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Low Quality Cube</p>
        Attempt 1: This one took five tries to actually get the print going, and still came out kinda mangled on one corner. Morale was at rock bottom. But we had a cube!!
        <br>Total time: 1.5 hours &#128128;&#128128;&#128128;
        <br>Size: 19.96 mm height x 20.08 mm width
        <br><br>Attempt 2: The next day I tried switching printers just in case that had caused any of my issues the night before. This one came out well on the first try! I believe the anime girl sticker on this printer is my guardian angel.
        <br>Time: Maybe 10 ish minutes?
        <br>Size: 19.84 mm height x 20.21 mm width

        <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Normal Quality Cube</p>
        Nothing much to report for the rest of the basic shape prints, mercifully they all went pretty smoothly from here! 
        I was hoping to be able to kick off a larger batch at once after I started getting the hang of things, but I learned that these shapes wouldn't fit under the printer as it was making the others if it printed them one at a time to accomodate their various settings. 
        It was also at this point that I got a recommendation to try Prusa Slicer from one of my fellow printing dungeonmates. This ended up coming in handy for my clips later!
        <br>
        Time: Maybe 20 ish minutes?
        <br>Size: 20.08 mm height x 20.00 width

      <p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">High Quality Cube</p>
        Time: Not sure - I kicked it off and left for the night. Cura estimated over an hour but I noticed the prints usually took longer than Cura's estimates. I was having trouble getting accurate times on things since the printer didn't seem to keep track reliably, or my prints would get moved since I came in over the course of 3 or 4 days.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Clips</p>
        Once I had gotten my basic shapes out of the way, I came back on Sunday ready to design my clips. I got to the lab a bit early so I could be fully prepped and ready to make the most of Nathan's office hours and........ I realized I had forgotten to bring cardboard &#128128;&#128128;&#128128;&#128128;&#128128;&#128128;
        There was none in the recycling bin at the mill, the front desk person said they didn't have any extra, and I checked one more place on campus before resorting to scrounging behind a building in the U District. 
        You know you're down bad when you see this and think JACKPOT!!!! &#128514;&#129396;
        <img src="assignment3\IMG_7074.jpg"/>
        
        <br>I was trying to keep it as simple as possible, so I thought about a straight clip with notches on either end to attach sheets side by side, and a sort of corner joint version of this so I could make a box. 
        I designed first clip to be about 4cm x 3cm.
        Cura estimated it would take over 20 minutes, which I decided was too long to test out the first prototype.
        I asked Nathan and he agreed that that seemed long, so we tried a shorter version and I also finally downloaded Prusa Slicer to see if that made a difference in speed.
        With the shorter clip model in Prusa Slicer it said it should be more like 6 minutes, so I tested it out.

        <br><br>
        This one passed the shake test! But then I was thinking about how long it would take to print all the full-sized ones, and started to wonder what I would even make with them anyways.
        Every minute that I'm not printing cute little doll things with my translucent hot pink filament feels like I am disobeying the will of Goddess herself, so I thought if I made the clips really small I could make a palatial Barbie dream house... out of little plastic bits and dirty cardboard... ok maybe it's more like Barbie's starter home. 
        I created a smaller version and tried printing 10 more after the first test came out well. Since this clip wasn't so tall, I tried it without a brim, hoping this would be nice for multiples since it was tough to get the brim out of the notch of the first test.

        <br>
        <div class="grid">
          <img src="assignment3\IMG_7077.jpg"/>
          <img src="assignment3\IMG_7078.jpg"/>
        </div>
        <br>
        No brim = DISASTER!!! My filament also got horrendously tangled somehow. But even after untangling it, the second round of clips weren't sticking well to the bed. I gave up on the brimless idea and printed 14 more with a brim!

        <br><br>
        I was still really hoping to make corner joints so that I could make the four walls the house and a roof. I was really stuck in Rhino because 
        somehow I must have trimmed a couple segments of the lines that were right on the axes so I couldn't see that they were missing.
        Once I realized this and fixed it I was able to extrude the corner joint shape and print it.

        <br><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Final Results</p>
        These were the little straight and corner clips I ended up with!
        <img src="assignment3\IMG_7131.jpg"/>
        <br><br>Since I knew I would be out of town through the following weekend, I was also trying to get ahead on the next homework and didn't get a chance to assemble a structure with my clips before I flew out. 
        So I did what any normal and sane person would do and packed a bunch of cardboard into my suitcase and took it to Mexico and spent my first afternoon building Tyongya's Cabo Dream House &#129396;&#129396;

        <br>Subjecting him to the shake test you required... Now that you see the faces of your victims is it worth it?!?? &#128561;

        (I kept the roof as a separate piece so I could put Tyongya in and out of the house like a regular doll house, so that's why it's not exactly up to earthquake code.)

        <br><br>
        Anyways I'm sure half the people in this class have designed clips that will one day prove instrumental in the cure for cancer, but in the meantime I hope you have enjoyed reading about my janky little dollhouse!! &#129392;
