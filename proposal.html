        Create a proposal pitch for your final project. Your pitch should include:
        <br>- a concept, including concept sketches, intended use case, context
        <br>- a breakdown of tasks (e.g. CAD modelling, 3d printing, casting, finishing)
        <br>- a timeline with contingency plans
        <br>- a Bill of Materials with sourcing schedule

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Concept/Intended Use Case/Context</p>
        I thought it would be fun to design some stuff for a knitting kit! At first I thought it would be the most fun 
        to sort of see if I could recreate all the main important stuff in my existing knitting kit through our fabrication 
        methods, but then just being realistic about time I think some of the metal cylindrical stuff would be pretty 
        challenging. So then I was thinking more along the lines of stuff that would either be on my knitting kit wish list 
        and solve a problem for me, or would just be fun and not too too difficult to make in two weeks. 

        <br><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Problems with Current Setup</p>
        * I started brainstorming potential problems I could solve with my current setup:
        <br>- Stuff is in random places all over my house
        <br>- If I need something at the bottom of my knitting tin I have to take other stuff out since it only fits if 
        everything is arranged a certain way
        <br>- Tapestry needle package takes up too much space in knitting tin
        <br>- Tough to get accurate gauge measurement with floppy measuring tape
        <br>- Sometimes a pair of needles gets separated from its package and size isn't labeled
        <br>- Difficult to wind yarn by hand
        <br>- Circular needles are currently crammed into a bag

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">General Requirements/Considerations for a Knitting Kit </p>
        - modular/portable - smaller container with more commonly used pieces that can easily be thrown into a 
        project bag, detachable from larger/more stationary pieces like storage for needles and yarn winding stuff 
        <br>- hard shell - some sharp parts like scissors, needles, etc.
        <br>- would be nice to have removable shelves for smaller parts 
        <br>- needs to close securely to be tossed in a bag
        <br>- for stuff that can be packed away, it's ok if it's not cute (e.g. swift) but maybe needle hanger would be 
        nicer if it was made out of wood if it'll be hanging on a door/wall

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Potential Techniques to Integrate</p>
        * Brainstorming ways I could incorporate various techniques based on what I'd like to design and what properties they should have:
        <br>- laser cutting (things that can be designed in 2D) - gauge window, needle measuring tool 
        <br>- incorporating stock parts (things that need to interact with existing stuff/where dimensions are important) - 
        gauge window, needle measuring tool, tapestry needle holder, needle stoppers
        <br>- Rhino - modeling 3D parts
        <br>- 3D printing (things that should be hard/smooth/light)- tapestry needle holder mold, yarn swift, modular organizer, 
        yarn bowl, needle hanger 
        <br>- mold design (things that should be squishy) - tapestry needle holder, needle stoppers 

        <br><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Bare Minimum Plan</p>
        * The smallest/most straightforward things that would solve an existing problem and integrate the most techniques:
        <br> - gauge window (laser cut, made of wood or particle board. use 2D design, laser cutting, and incorporating stock parts.)
        <br>- tapestry needle holder (molded out of silicone. use 3D design, incorporating stock parts, 3D printing, designing a mold, Rhino)

        <br><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Stretch Goals</p>
        * I recognize that a couple small odds and ends won't exactly make for a jaw-dropping showcase display lol, so I'm 
        hoping if I keep it super simple I can at least make sure to meet the assignment requirements and maybe even make 
        something useful for myself. But I'm hoping that things will go smoothly and I'll have enough time to try something 
        more impressive! I am trying to give myself a bunch of options depending on how much time I have left over.
        <br>- yarn swift (3D printed. this would involve mechanisms so it may be pretty difficult to get one working well enough to actually use)
        <br>- needle hanger (laser cut. this could be an easy ish thing to add on if I have a couple extra days)
        <br>- modular organizer (3D printed. this could be fun to design but my main concern is that I won't actually use it since I am 
        for some reason emotionally attached to my current little knitting tin lol)
        <br>- stitch markers (3D printed. could be fun and easy! you can never have too many and it would be fun to give them as gifts to friends)
        <br>- needle stoppers (molded out of silicone. I do enjoy squishy things so it could be fun, but molding has so many 
        time-consuming steps. we'll see what I'm in the mood for!)
        <img src="proposal/stretch_goals.png"/>

        <br><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Tasks/Timeline</p>
        * Days to work between now and the 29th -> 13 - 2 days out of town = 11
        <br>* Estimates based on what I've been able to accomplish in a given calendar day so far this quarter
        <br>- Design gauge window laser cut in Cuttle (1 day)
        <br>- Go to the lab to laser cut (1 day)
        <br>- Design mold pieces in Rhino (1 day)
        <br>- Go to the lab to 3D print mold pieces (1 day)
        <br>- Cast silicone needle holder (1 day)
        <br>- Write up docs (1 day)
        <br>Total days if everything goes miraculously well: 6

        <br><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Bill of Materials/Sourcing Schedule</p>
        * I would ideally like to use up as much leftover/recycled material as I can vs. buying new
        <br>- wood/particle board - check near laser cutter in the lab. otherwise can get same day from hardware store.
        <br>- filament - I think I already have plenty for my purposes. otherwise can get same day from the lab.
        <br>- OOMOO - I think I have enough left over. otherwise came in a few days ordering online.

        <br><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Contingency Plans</p>
        - may take more time to figure out settings for laser cutting wood/particle board since I've only 
        cut cardboard so far. leaving buffer in case I have to come back a second day (+1 day)
        <br>- may need more OOMOO/may be delayed in getting it. 3D print stitch markers instead (+2 days)
        <br>- any number of things may go wrong with the end-to-end mold-making process. leaving an extra 
        day of buffer each for the 3D printing phase and the casting phase (+2 days)
        <br>- if none of these things happen then I will have 5 "free" days! if I'm feeling really ambitious, 
        I will try to make the yarn swift since that would be the #1 thing on my knitting kit wish list.
        <br>- if only a couple things go wrong, can try as many of the smaller/easier things as I have time for, 
        e.g. 3D printed stitch markers, laser cut needle hanger, 3D printed modular organizer, molded needle stoppers
