        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Modeling</p>
        I was hoping the modeling portion of this assignment would be 
        a breeze this week since Rhino has all those fancy draft angle analysis 
        and ribbon offset doodads that were supposed to make my life soooo easy. 
        But I tried it on a couple different little guys from Thingiverse, as 
        well as the silhouette thing from the tutorial Emily posted, and idk 
        just nothing was working!!!! I googled and cried and googled some more 
        and messed with the meshes and shrink wrapped them just for good measure 
        since that was the magic command that fixed everything before so idk 
        worth a shot???? but couldn't get a line to generate.

        I tried to think what the simplest possible shape would be that I could 
        easily model that would lend itself to a mold. Looking around the 
        crazy kpop dungeon that is my living room, I thought maybe I could try 
        the shape of the little NewJeans bunny guy (pictured below as a keychain). 
        At this point I had abandoned all hope for a clever parting line, so 
        I figured a flat-ish shape would be more my speed.

        Even with a much simpler model, I was still having some trouble. For 
        example, I tried to put a sprue above the key ring loop, but 
        boolean-unioning the little cylinder only worked on one side?? 
        And the other side just... I don't even know..... Left a weird mark 
        but didn't show up? I retried it a few times and eventually 
        figured maybe it would be ok since it would still have half a cylinder's 
        worth of sprue from the other side?

        <br><br>
        After painstakingly building up my models with their sprues and keys 
        and even little heart/star eyes on one side (essential features of a 
        proper mold) I realized that I had just modeled the part that was 
        supposed to be the silicone &#129313;&#129313;&#129313;&#129313;&#129313; 
        I panicked for a few minutes thinking I'd have to redo it all, but 
        opposite?! And then I was like oh wait I guess I can just stamp it 
        out of a bigger rectangle to make the negative of it like I did with 
        the bunny shape lol. Crisis averted!!

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Printing Molds-for-Molds</p>
        The next day I took my models to the lab to 3D print them. I was a bit 
        worried about getting the silicone molds back out of the little plastic boxes, but 
        I thought I'd just print them small and see what happened since I was 
        struggling to visualize all the parts working together already. The first 
        attempt printed well on the first try!! But it took forever so I was hoping 
        I could thin out the sides of the box and make it shallower. However 
        after several failed attempts, I gave up on this and just kicked off another 
        full-sized one. The next day I picked it up and it had worked! Yay!

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Making the Mold</p>
        After I picked up my mold-for-mold, I took it home and set up my molding 
        station lol. Highly professional operation over here.

        <br><br>
        I filled up my precision chemistry measuring instruments (solo cups) with 
        equal parts of the two liquids, and crossed my fingers for 6 hours. 
        It worked!! Woohoo!! I like the squishy cubes hehe.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Casting</p>
        First I tried making an ice cube just to see if my mold would work at all. 
        The keys fit together and the sprues seemed... reasonable?? And it filled 
        up with water decently so I left it in the freezer for a few hours. 
        When I went back to check on it all the water had leaked out of the bottom lol. 
        I tried one more time, this time securing it with rubber bands 
        instead of just sort of shoving it into a cup. I left it overnight and it came 
        out pretty well! The key ring loop broke when I tried to break off the 
        sprue, but other than that I didn't notice any major issues.

        I stopped by the lab one more time to pick up the plaster. I tried the 3:1 
        water to plaster ratio I saw Rene mention in Discord... At least I thought 
        it was water to plaster? But it was so liquidy I kept adding more plaster 
        until it thickened up a bit. The first one came out... not bad!! I kept 
        trying throughout the day, but struggled to keep the ratio consistent. I'd 
        get an okay one, then one that sort of separated or didn't set right or 
        didn't fill in properly and left an air bubble.

        </div>
        
        <br><br>
        By the end of the day I managed four okay-enough casts! I think if I could 
        redo it I would make the whole thing a lot bigger so that the sprues 
        were smaller in proportion to the main shape so that I could break them 
        off easier without worrying that I'd break more pieces off. I also noticed 
        that part of the heart eye never really got filled in so maybe that would 
        need its own sprue? But if they're all grotesquely deformed in the same ways perhaps they 
        can still be considered identical..? &#129488; They're sisters not quadruplets okay!!!
